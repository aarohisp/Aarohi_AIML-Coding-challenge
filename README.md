# AIML Coding challenge 

## Description:
This project focuses on forecasting sourcing costs using historical data on product types, manufacturers, area codes, sourcing channels, product sizes, and sourcing costs. The task involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, outlier detection, and modeling using ARIMA, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting models.

This project focused on forecasting sourcing costs using historical data, involving data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, outlier detection, and modelling with ARIMA and LSTM models. The dataset provided insights into various attributes influencing costs, split into training and test sets for evaluation. The ARIMA and LSTM models were utilised for forecasting, with evaluation based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE). The project successfully addressed cost forecasting through a comprehensive analysis, highlighting the models' ability to capture trends and patterns accurately. Further optimisation and feature exploration could enhance forecasting accuracy and adaptability to changing data dynamics.
